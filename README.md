# My Blog

## Description

In this project I createda personal blkog web application. In oreder to achieve this I had to apply all my new knowledge. The structure of th page was done with HTML. To style the web page I used CSS style attributes. The logic of the page was handled by JavaScript. In this I implemented taking information from a form a storing it in Local Storage. Also, we used JavaScript to change the them of the page from light to dark.
